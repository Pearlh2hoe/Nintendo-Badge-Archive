# Nintendo-Badge-Archive
A WIP archive of nintendo badge arcade badges released in europe.

Will be updated once a week, im still working on getting more badges, i try to always get every badge every day.
Huge thanks to MrCheeze for making GYTB, the tool used to dump the badges https://github.com/MrCheeze/GYTB

# Notes:
Im considering bi weekly releases, considering the ammount of new badges im getting per week is decreasing.
If someone knows a way to change what catchers appear every day, please contact me on discord: @Pearl#0379
